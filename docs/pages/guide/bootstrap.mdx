# Bootstrapping Qwik

Qwik is designed to have the smallest amount of code which needs to be run on the client to bootstrap the application. The size of bootstrap code has a direct impact on application [time to interactive](https://web.dev/interactive/).

The bootstrapping code is known as `qwikloader` and is tiny (around 500 bytes minified) and can bootstrap in under one millisecond. The purpose of `qwikloader` is to set up global browser event listeners for your application, such as `click` events. If an event fires, the `qwikloader` looks for a corresponding `on:click` attribute which contains a [QRL](./QRL.md). The QRL tells `qwikloader` where to download the handler for the `click` event.

## Bootstrapping

To bootstrap a Qwik application one needs to insert this into the page:

```html
<script src="/qwikloader.min.js" async events="click;dblclick;keyup"></script>
```

- `src`: points to the location where the `qwikloader.js` can be found.
- `async`: Tells the browser that it is not necessary to wait for the `qwikloader` to load and execute before continuing to parse the HTML. The application will work without this, but adding `async` will slightly improve the startup time.
- `events`: An optional list of events which the `qwikloader` should listen to. If the list is not provided the `qwikloader` will listen to all of the browser events. While this may be convenient, it will result in longer bootstrap times. Listing the events is strongly preferred.
