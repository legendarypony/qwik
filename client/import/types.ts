/**
 * `QRL` (Qoot Resource Locator) represents an import which points to a lazy loaded resource.
 *
 * QRL is a URL pointing to a lazy loaded resource. Because the URLs need to be verified
 * (and possibly bundled) there needs to be a way to identify all URL strings in the system.
 * QRL serves the purpose of statically tagging all URLs for static code analysis and for
 * development mode verification.
 *
 * In dev mode (`qDev=true`) the `QRL` eagerly tries to resolve the URLs to verify that they
 * are correct. This is done to notify the developer of any mistakes as soon as possible.
