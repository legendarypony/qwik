      noUseVisibleTask: `Qwik tries very hard to defer client code execution for as long as possible.
This is done to give the end-user the best possible user experience.
Running code eagerly blocks the main thread, which prevents the user from interacting until the task is finished.
"useVisibleTask$" is provided as an escape hatch.

When in doubt, instead of "useVisibleTask$()" use:
- useTask$ -> perform code execution in SSR mode.
- useOn() -> listen to events on the root element of the current component.
- useOnWindow() -> listen to events on the window object.
- useOnDocument() -> listen to events on the document object.

Sometimes it is the only way to achieve the result.
In that case, add:
// eslint-disable-next-line qwik/no-use-visible-task
to the line before "useVisibleTask$" to acknowledge you understand.
