# Integration

This folder contains internal e2e integration tests as well as examples of usage of the sub-framework.

## Examples:

- [`hello_static`](./hello_static/): The simplest possible app demonstrating lazy loading (but not server-side rendering.)
- [`hello_server`](./hello_server/): A simple example with server-side rendering demonstrating re-hydration of the application on the client.
- [`todo`](./todo/): Classical Todo application implemented with Qwik.

## Todo

First build Qwik with either `npm start` or `npm run build`. Next `cd` into the `integrations/todo` directory and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```
